# 📊 Rachit Shukla – Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my personal Data Analytics portfolio!  
This repository showcases hands-on projects using **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Alteryx**, focused on solving real-world business problems.  
📺 I also run a YouTube channel — **Data Gyaan by Rachit** — where I share tutorials and insights to help others learn data skills faster.

I’m currently expanding into **SQL**, **Python**, and **Cloud Analytics (GCP & Azure)** as part of my journey to become a full-stack data professional.
