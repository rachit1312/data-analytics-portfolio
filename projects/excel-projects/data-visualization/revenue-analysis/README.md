# 📊 Excel Revenue Analysis Project

The dataset used contains customer and sales information, which is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to extract meaningful business insights.

## 🔧 1. Data Cleaning (Power Query)

The raw dataset was cleaned using Power Query with the following steps:

- Removed duplicate rows  
- Changed the data type of the date column from number to Date  
- Merged first and last name columns  
- Rounded decimal values in the Units column  
- Formatted the Sales Person column (capitalized each word, trimmed spaces)

✅ *Data cleaning completed successfully.*

## 📈 2. Data Analysis

Performed analysis using Excel formulas and Pivot Tables:

- Total revenue calculation  
- Revenue breakdown by Sales Person (sorted from highest to lowest)  
- Gender-based customer analysis  
  - ~53% of customers are female  
  - Suggests better ROI if marketing targets females more

✅ *Data analysis completed successfully.*

## 📊 3. Data Visualization

Visualized the insights using Excel charts and formatting:

- **Conditional Formatting**: Data bars on revenue by sales person  
- **Scatter Plot**: Showed positive correlation between Age and Revenue  
  - Trendline equation: Every +1 year in age = ~$340 increase in revenue  
- **Box Plot**: Checked for revenue outliers  
  - No outliers found (no dots beyond whiskers)

✅ *Visuals created for clear decision-making support.*
