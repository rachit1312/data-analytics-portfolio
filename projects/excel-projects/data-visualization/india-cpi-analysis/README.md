# 📈 Analysis of India's Consumer Price Index (CPI)

This project focuses on analyzing India’s **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** using Excel to extract key insights on inflation patterns, category-wise contribution, and the impact of global and national events (like COVID-19 and crude oil price changes) on the economy.

The goal is to transform raw CPI data into **business-style, interactive visual insights** using clean charts, labels, and summary analysis — all built using Microsoft Excel.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify major contributors to inflation using CPI category breakdowns  
- Visualize **Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y)** and **Month-on-Month (MoM)** inflation patterns  
- Compare **Pre and Post COVID-19** inflation impacts  
- Measure **correlation between Crude Oil prices and CPI categories**  
- Present results through clear and intuitive Excel dashboards
